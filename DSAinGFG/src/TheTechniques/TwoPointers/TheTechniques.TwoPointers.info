/**
 * TWO-POINTERS TECHNIQUE OVERVIEW
 * * DESCRIPTION:
 * The Two-Pointers technique is an algorithmic strategy that uses two indices (pointers)
 * to traverse a data structure (array, list, or string) efficiently. It is a
 * fundamental optimization tool that often reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).
 *
 * KEY PATTERNS:
 * 1. Opposite Ends:
 * - Pointers start at 'left' (0) and 'right' (n-1).
 * - Commonly used for Sorted Arrays, Palindromes, and Reversing elements.
 * * 2. Slow & Fast (Tortoise and Hare):
 * - One pointer moves 1 step, the other moves 2 steps.
 * - Essential for Linked List Cycle Detection and finding the middle node.
 * * 3. Sliding Window:
 * - Pointers define a range [left...right] that expands or shrinks dynamically.
 * - Used for finding subarrays or substrings meeting specific criteria.
 *
 * WHY USE IT?
 * - Efficiency: Optimizes nested loops into a single linear pass.
 * - Space: Usually requires O(1) extra space as it works in-place.
 * * WHEN TO APPLY:
 * - When the input is sorted.
 * - When searching for pairs, triplets, or subarrays.
 * - When dealing with Linked List structure issues.
